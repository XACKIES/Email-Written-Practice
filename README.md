## Introducing Myself

Dear Mr. [Last Name],

My name is Kittiphop Phanthachart. I am currently looking for R&D Managers in the Bangkok area, and my friend mentioned you.
I am putting together a proposal for a new CTO, and so far, I have gathered several expert engineers within the company. I would love to share more details with you.
Please let me know when you are available for a discussion.

I look forward to speaking with you.


Best regards,
Kittiphop Phanthachart
Project Coordinator
